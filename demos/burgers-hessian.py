# Burgers equation with Hessian-based mesh adaptation
# ===================================================

# Yet again, we revisit the Burgers equation example. This time, we apply Hessian-based
# mesh adaptation. The interesting thing about this demo is that, unlike the
# `previous demo <./point_discharge2d-goal_oriented.py.html>`__ and its predecessor,
# we consider the time-dependent case. Moreover, we consider a :class:`MeshSeq` with
# multiple subintervals and hence multiple meshes to adapt.
#
# As before, we copy over what is now effectively boiler plate to set up our problem. ::

# As in the previous adaptation demos, the most important part is the adaptor function.
# The one used here takes a similar form, except that we need to handle multiple meshes
# and metrics.
#
# Since the Burgers equation has a vector solution, we recover the Hessian of each
# component at each timestep and intersect them. We then time integrate these Hessians
# to give the metric contribution from each subinterval. Given that we use a simple
# implicit Euler method for time integration in the PDE, we do the same here, too.
#
# Goalie provides functionality to normalise a list of metrics using *space-time*
# normalisation. This ensures that the target complexity is attained on average across
# all timesteps.
#
# Note that when adapting the mesh, we need to be careful to check whether convergence
# has already been reached on any of the subintervals. If so, the adaptation step is
# skipped. ::

# Recall that the Burgers problem is quasi-1D, since the analytical solution varies in
# the :math:`x`-direction, but is constant in the :math:`y`-direction. As such, we can
# affort to have lower resolution in the :math:`y`-direction in adapted meshes. That
# this occurs is clear from the plots above. The solution moves to the right, becoming
# more densely distributed near to the right-hand boundary. This can be seen by
# comparing the second mesh against the first.
#
# .. rubric:: Exercise
#
# In this demo, we obtain a Hessian metric by recovering Hessians of the two velocity
# components and combining them using metric intersection. Try out other approaches,
# such as combining using metric addition and recovering a single Hessian of the speed
# (i.e., the square root of the dot product of the velocity with itself).
#
# This demo can also be accessed as a `Python script <burgers-hessian.py>`__.
