# Advection-diffusion-reaction
# ============================
#
# We have already seen time-dependent advection equations and a steady-state
# advection-diffusion equation. In this demo, we increase the level of complexity again
# and solve the Gray-Scott advection-diffusion-reaction equation, as described in
# :cite:`Hundsdorfer:2003`.
#
# The test case consists of two tracer species, which experience different
# diffusivities and react with one another nonlinearly. ::
