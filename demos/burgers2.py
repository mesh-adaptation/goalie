# Adjoint Burgers equation on two meshes
# =========================================
#
# This demo solves the same adjoint problem as `the previous one
# <./burgers1.py.html>`__, but now using two subintervals. There
# is still no error estimation or mesh adaptation; the same mesh
# is used in each case to verify that the framework works.
#
# Again, begin by importing Goalie with adjoint mode activated. ::

# uses conservative projection to transfer inbetween. This also happens in
# the forward pass of :func:`solve_adjoint`, but is followed by running the
# *adjoint* of the solver on each subinterval *in reverse*. The adjoint of
# the conservative projection operator is applied to transfer adjoint solution
# data between meshes in this case. If you think about the matrix
# representation of a projection operator then this effectively means taking
# the transpose. Again, the meshes (and hence function spaces) are identical,
# so the transfer is just the identity.

# Snapshots of the adjoint solution are again plotted using the
# :func:`plot_snapshots` utility function. ::

# The adjoint solution fields at each time level appear to match
# those due to the previous demo at each timestep. That they actually
# do coincide is checked in Goalie's test suite.

#
# Note that the keyword argument ``diagonal="left"`` was passed to the
# ``UnitSquareMesh`` constructor in this example, defining which way
# the diagonal lines in the uniform mesh should go. Instead of having
# both function spaces defined on this mesh, try defining the second
# one in a :math:`\mathbb P2` space defined on a **different** mesh
# which is constructed with ``diagonal="right"``. How does the adjoint
# solution change when the solution is trasferred between different
# meshes? In this case, the mesh-to-mesh transfer operations will no
# longer simply be identities.
#
# In the `next demo <./burgers_time_integrated.py.html>`__, we solve
# the same problem but with a QoI involving an integral in time, as
# well as space.
#
# This demo can also be accessed as a `Python script <burgers2.py>`__.
