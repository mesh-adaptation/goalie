# Adjoint Burgers equation with a time integrated QoI
# ======================================================
#
# So far, we only considered a quantity of interest
# corresponding to a spatial integral at the end time.
# For some problems, it is more suitable to have a QoI
# which integrates in time as well as space.

# of the :class:`AdjointMeshSeq` as follows. ::

# With a time-integrated QoI, the adjoint problem
# has a source term at the right-hand boundary, rather
# than a instantaneous pulse at the terminal time. As such,
# the adjoint solution field accumulates at the right-hand
# boundary, as well as propagating westwards.
#
# In the `next demo <./burgers_oo.py.html>`__, we solve
# the Burgers problem one last time, but using an
# object-oriented approach.
#
# This demo can also be accessed as a `Python script <burgers_time_integrated.py>`__.
