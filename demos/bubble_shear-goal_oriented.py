# Goal-oriented mesh adaptation for a 2D time-dependent problem
# =============================================================

# In a `previous demo <./bubble_shear.py.html>`__, we considered the advection of a
# scalar concentration field in a non-uniform background velocity field. The demo
# concluded with labelling the problem as a good candidate for a goal-oriented mesh
# adaptation approach. This is what we set out to do in this demo.
#
# We will use the same setup as in the original demo, but a small modifiction to the
# :meth:`get_form` function is necessary in order to take into account a prescribed
# time-dependent background velocity field which is not passed to
# :class:`GoalOrientedMeshSeq`. ::

# Compared to the solution obtained on a fixed uniform mesh in the previous demo, we
# observe that the final solution at :math:`t=T/2` better matches the initial tracer
# bubble :math:`c_0` and is less diffused. Despite employing only two fixed
# point iterations, the goal-oriented mesh adaptation process was still able to
# significantly improve the accuracy of the solution while reducing the number of
# degrees of freedom by half.
#
# As shown in the above figure, the bubble experiences extreme deformation and requires
# frequent adaptation to be resolved accurately (surely more than 5, as in this demo!).
# We encourage users to experiment with different numbers of subintervals, number of
# exports per subinterval, adaptor functions, and other parameters to explore the
# convergence of the fixed point iteration. Another interesting experiment would be to
# compare the impact of switching to an explicit time integration and using a smaller
# timestep to maintain numerical stability (look at CFL condition).
