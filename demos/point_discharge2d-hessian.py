# Hessian-based mesh adaptation for a 2D steady-state problem
# ===========================================================
#
# Previous demos have covered the fundamental time partition and mesh sequence objects
# of Goalie, using them to solve PDEs over multiple meshes and perform
# goal-oriented error estimation. Here, we demonstrate how to use them for Hessian-based
# mesh adaptation for a steady-state problem in 2D.
#
# It is recommended that you read the documentation on metric-based mesh adaptation
# before progressing with this demo.
#
# In addition to importing from Firedrake and Goalie, we also import the mesh
# adaptation functionality from Firedrake, which can be found in ``firedrake.meshadapt``.

# In order to perform metric-based mesh adaptation, we need to tell the mesh
# sequence how to define metrics and adapt its meshes. Since we have a steady-state
# problem, there is only ever one mesh, one solution field, and one metric, so this
# simplifies things significantly.
#
# For this first example, we compute a metric by recovering the Hessian of the
# approximate solution field, and scaling it according to a desired *metric complexity*
# using :math:`L^p` normalisation. The normalised metric is used to adapt the mesh,
# which we print the obtained metric complexity and DoF count of the adapted mesh. Since
# the solution is sought in :math:`\mathbb P1` space, the DoF count is just the vertex
# count. ::
