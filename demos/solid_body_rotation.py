# Solid body rotation
# ===================

# So far, we have only solved Burgers equation, which can
# be thought of as a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation.
# Let us now consider a simple `linear` advection equation,
#
# .. math::
#    \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla c = 0,
#
# which is solved for a tracer concentration :math:`c`. The
# velocity field :math:`\mathbf{u}` drives the transport.
# A new piece of information in this demo is the approach to
# strongly imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions in Goalie.
# In particular, we impose
#
# .. math::
#    c|_{\partial\Omega}=0,
#
# where :math:`\Omega` is the spatial domain of interest.
#
# Consider the `Firedrake`
# `DG advection demo <https://firedrakeproject.org/demos/DG_advection.py.html>`__.
# In this demo, a tracer is advected in a rotational
# velocity field such that its final concentration should be
# identical to its initial solution. If the tracer
# concentration is interpreted as a third spatial dimension,
# the initial condition is comprised of a Gaussian bell, a
# cone and a cylinder with a cuboid slot removed from it.
# The cone is more difficult to advect than the bell because
# of its discontinuous gradient at its peak and the slotted
# cylinder is yet more difficult to advect because of its
# curve of discontinuities. The test case was introduced in
# :cite:`LeVeque:1996`.
#
# As usual, we import from Firedrake and Goalie, with
# adjoint mode activated. ::

# For simplicity, we use a :math:`\mathbb P1` space for each
# field. The domain of interest is again the unit square, in
