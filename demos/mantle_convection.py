# Mantle convection modelling
#############################

# In all demos that we have considered so far, the equations that we have solved all
# involve a time derivative. However, in some cases, we may have a time-dependent
# problem where an equation might not involve a time derivative, but is still
# time-dependent in the sense that it depends on other fields that are time-dependent
# and that have been previously solved for. An example of where this might happen is
# in a continuous pressure projection approach, ice sheet and glaciological modelling,
# mantle convection modelling, etc. In this demo, we illustrate how Goalie can be used
# to solve such problems.

# We consider the problem of a mantle convection in a 2D unit square domain. The
# governing equations and Firedrake implementation are based on the 2D Cartesian
# incompressible isoviscous case from :cite:`Davies:2022`. We refer the reader to the
# paper for a detailed description of the problem and implementation. Here we
# immediately present the governing equations involving a Stokes system and an energy
# equation, which we solve for the velocity :math:`\mathbf{u}`, pressure :math:`p`, and
# temperature :math:`T`:
#
# .. math::
#    \begin{align}
#        \nabla \cdot \mu \left[\nabla \mathbf{u} + (\nabla \mathbf{u})^T \right] - \nabla p + \mathrm{Ra}\,T\,\mathbf{k} &= 0, \\
#        \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \cdot \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla T - \nabla \cdot (\kappa\nabla T) &= 0,
#    \end{align}
#
# where :math:`\mu`, :math:`\kappa`, and :math:`\mathrm{Ra}` are constant viscosity,
# thermal diffusivity, and Rayleigh number, respectively, and :math:`\mathbf{k}` is
# the unit vector in the direction opposite to gravity. Note that while the Stokes
# equations do not involve a time derivative, they are still time-dependent as they
# depend on the temperature field :math:`T`, which is time-dependent.
#
# As always, we begin by importing Firedrake and Goalie, and defining constants.
