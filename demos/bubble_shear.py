# Advection of a tracer bubble in a non-uniform shear flow
# ========================================================

# In this demo, we consider the advection of a scalar concentration field, similarly to
# the `solid body rotation demo <./solid_body_rotation.py.html>`__. However, we now
# consider a background velocity field that is not uniform in time. We further prescribe
# homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions for the concentration, so in this demo we
# solve the following advection problem:
#
# .. math::
#   \begin{array}{rl}
#       \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\mathbf{u}c)=0& \text{in}\:\Omega\\
#       c=0 & \text{on}\:\partial\Omega,\\
#       c=c_0(x,y) & \text{at}\:t=0,
#   \end{array},
#
# where :math:`c=c(x,y,t)` is the sought tracer concentration,
# :math:`\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{u}(x,y,t)` is the background velocity field, and
# :math:`\Omega=[0, 1]^2` is the spatial domain of interest.
#
# First, we import Firedrake and Goalie. ::

from firedrake import *
from goalie import *

# We begin by definining the background velocity field :math:`\mathbf{u}(x, y, t)`.
# Specifically, we choose the velocity field that is periodic in time, such as
# in :cite:<Barral:2016>, and is given by
#
# .. math::
#   \mathbf{u}(x, y, t) := \cos(2\pi t/T)\left(2\sin^2(\pi x)\sin(2\pi y), -\sin(2\pi x)\sin^2(\pi y) \right),
#
# where :math:`T` is the period. At each timestep of the simulation we will have to
# update this field so we define a function that will return this vector expression. ::

        ]
    )

# However, since the background velocity :math:`\mathbf{u}` is already known, we do not
# solve for it and pass it as a field to :class:`MeshSeq`. Instead, we pass only the
# tracer concentration :math:`c` and, for now, avoid specifying how to handle the
# velocity field. Therefore, at this stage we only define how to build the
# :class:`FunctionSpace` for the tracer concentration. ::

# We proceed similarly with prescribing initial and boundary conditions. At :math:`t=0`,
# we initialise the tracer concentration :math:`c_0 = c(x, y, 0)` to be :math:`1` inside
# a circular region of radius :math:`r_0=0.15` centred at :math:`(x_0, y_0)=(0.5, 0.65)`
# and :math:`0` elsewhere in the domain. Note that this is a discontinuous function
# which will not be represented well on a coarse uniform mesh. ::

# define the velocity field.

# :math:`\psi`. To advance in time, we use Crank-Nicolson timestepping. ::

# In the first part of the simulation, we observe that the initial tracer bubble becomes
# increasingly deformed by the strong shear forces. However, we notice that the
# deformation appears to be reverting. This is due to the periodicity of the velocity
# field :math:`\mathbf{u}`, which we chose to be an odd function of time. This means
# that the velocity field reverses direction at :math:`t=T/2`, and so does the
# deformation of the tracer bubble, which returns to its initial shape.
#
# However, while the tracer bubble at :math:`t=T/2` does resemble a very blurry circular
# shape, it is far from matching the initial condition. This "bluriness" is the result
# of adding the SUPG stabilisation to the weak form, which adds numerical diffusion.
# Adding diffusion is necessary for numerical stability and for preventing oscillations,
# but it also makes the solution irreversible. The amount of difussion added is related
# to the grid PÃ©clet number :math:`Pe = U\,h/2D`: the coarser the mesh is, the more
# diffusion is added. We encourage the reader to verify this by running the simulation
# on a sequence of finer uniform meshes, and to visit the
# `bubble shear mesh adaptation demo <./bubble_shear-goal.py.html>`__, where we use a
# goal-oriented approach to identify areas of the domain that require refinement to
# reduce the numerical diffusion.

# This tutorial can be dowloaded as a `Python script <bubble_shear.py>`__.
